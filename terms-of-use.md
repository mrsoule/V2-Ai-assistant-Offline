UType provides writing assistance powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

On-Device Processing: Unlike cloud-based AI, UType is designed to process text locally on your hardware.

AI Output: To the extent permitted by law, UType assigns to you all rights, title, and interest in and to the text generated by the App based on your inputs. You may use this content for both personal and commercial purposes.

UType offers a limited free trial and a "Pro" version for unlimited access.

Free Limitations: The free version is limited to 10 inputs per 24-hour period for a duration of 3 days.

Billing: Payments are processed through the Apple App Store. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

5. Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to use the App to:

Generate content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, or promotes hate speech.

Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or extract the underlying model weights or software of the App.

Use the App in any manner that could interfere with the performance or security of the software.

The App's interface, branding, custom persona configurations, and underlying software are the exclusive property of the developer and are protected by copyright and trademark laws.

7. Disclaimer of Warranties
The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties that the AI output will meet your specific requirements or that the service will be 100% error-free.

8. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including loss of data or loss of profits) arising out of your use of the App or the content generated by the AI.

9. Changes and Updates
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of significant changes through an in-app update or by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
